	 <br><h1>Cloud computing</h1>
		<p>Cloud computing is a form of Internet-based computing that provides shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand.<br>Cloud computing is part of the ICT ecosystem, as cloud-‐computing services require ICT networks and internet infrastructure to function. ... Although cloud computing falls within ICT, no provision is made for cloud services in all ICT regulatory frameworks in the Uganda
		</p><p>Cloud computing is viewed as having the potential to significantly bolster economic growth through the provision of cost savings and efficiencies, including the cost of management of data and security. Some of the benefits of cloud computing could be immediately realised with the small-medium enterprise (SME) sector and the public sector. 

</p><p>Within the SME sector, cloud computing provides access to advanced IT technologies, which were previously only accessible to larger enterprises, thereby enhancing entrepreneurship and innovation. Furthermore, the public sector stands to gain from the cost-efficiencies offered by cloud computing. Though cloud providers are offering targeted cloud solutions for the SME sector, the use of these services has been limited. 

The paper highlights that the informal sector, which forms a significant part of businesses in Uganda as it provides livelihoods to the poor and marginalised, has the potential to enjoy benefits associated with the large-scale hardware and software investments in the formal sector through cloud services.

 </p><p>Although cloud computing is dominated by global US-based countries, it has the potential to open up African companies to unchartered offshore markets, thus contributing to economic development and competitiveness, and for African businesses to aggregate international cloud services to meet local needs. 

Cloud provision in most of the selected countries is supply-side driven rather than demand- side driven. The state in most of the selected African countries has been playing a key role in the cloud services market by promoting public cloud services as a delivery model for their e-government services.

</p><p> The use of the public cloud by the state will go a long way towards creating awareness and trust building in cloud-computing services. In addition, the education sector is increasingly taking an interest in cloud services through research and development efforts and conferences. Some educational institutions have migrated parts of their administration onto the cloud, while others have developed an education cloud that will bolster e-learning initiatives.

 South Africa is an exceptional case, as the growth of cloud-computing services is demand-side driven through the corporate sector; however there is a preference for private cloud services due to concerns around data protection and security. Nonetheless, it is believed that more companies will be forced to migrate to public cloud services and take advantage of the economies of scale offered, as a cost-cutting measure. 
</p><p>The enactment of legislation on data and security in line with global standards will go a long way towards driving adoption of these services. Cloud computing falls within the broader ICT ecosystem as it relies on broadband internet connectivity.
 Broadband infrastructure development in Uganda is uneven. While there has been significant growth in international bandwidth capacity and decline in costs through the landing of a number of international submarine cables, terrestrial fibre backbone infrastructure remains inadequate, as does last-mile connectivity. Most countries rely on ADSL connections and mobile broadband networks are widespread.

 </p><p>As a result, mobile phones are fast becoming the primary method of connecting to the internet in Uganda. However, in order to deliver cloud services for the corporate and public sector, there is a need to build up the national terrestrial backbone infrastructure. Several factors inhibit the widespread adoption of cloud services within developing countries.

 The availability, accessibility and affordability of underlying technology is a key determinant of the successful diffusion of cloud computing and is currently the major inhibiter to cloud deployment in developing countries. Other factors that are hindering the growth of cloud services relate to concerns around security, privacy and surveillance, particularly amongst highly regulated and risk-averse sectors, such as financial services. 

</p><p>This paper analyses and explains how the cloud-computing economy fits into the broader ICT ecosystem. It presents case studies and provides an assessment of the Cloud readiness African countries 2 market and regulatory frameworks in order to assess the cloud readiness of a selected number of African countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Tunisia). Several African governments are increasingly realising the benefits of adopting cloud computing and are taking on cloud strategies. 

This paper presents the key market trends regarding cloud computing within selected African countries in terms of the services currently on offer, the sectors using cloud services, and the perceived risks and regulatory challenges that pertain to the adoption of cloud computing within African states.

 </p><p>Finally, the paper provides policy recommendations on how to facilitate growth of the secure cloud services market within developing countries and thereby facilitate growth and development of an economy, while safeguarding the interests of their citizens. Introduction Much of the hype around cloud computing in Uganda is as a result of the adoption of highend technology and software by industries such as financial services, oil and gas; and of advanced next-generation networks by the telecommunications operators.

The emergence of cloud computing in Uganda is viewed as a natural extension of the deployment of advanced IT technologies by high-end users in both the consumer and enterprise services markets. In addition, cloud computing offers economies of scale that can dramatically reduce the cost to endusers. 

</p><p>On the demand side, the use of shared computing facilities improves efficiencies in infrastructural use as users effectively only pay for what they use. SMEs and public services stand to gain the most from the adoption of cloud services, which provides immediate access to the infrastructure and services previously only available to big enterprises able to invest heavily in IT.

 Cloud computing can create significant efficiency gains and enhance innovation and entrepreneurship (Gillwald, Moyo and Altman, 2012). Yet the adoption by the public sector and the SME sector has been slow, with some exceptions. The underlying reason for this failure of the cloud to take off is the on going problem of limited and uneven development of enabling infrastructure for the delivery of cloud services across the African continent.

 </p><p>Investment in international submarine cables has led to a significant rise in international bandwidth capacity at a reduced cost. There has also been significant investment in the rollout of broadband backbone infrastructure by public and private companies across the continent. However, this has not been sufficient and what is there is often not effectively regulated. 

Fair competition is achieved by ensuring wholesale access to the essential facilities. Incumbent operators also often retain dominance over essential facilities, including infrastructural backbone and the last mile. The unavailability and price of terrestrial backbone backhaul networks remain the bottlenecks in broadband uptake, together with the ongoing problem of lastmile connectivity. 

</p><p>This means that the informal business sector, which provides livelihood for the majority of poor Africans, is an untapped market for the delivery of public cloud services via mobile phones. Given the lack of a stable of power supply in most African markets, cloud computing presents an attractive value preposition for those wishing to eliminate the high costs of investment in infrastructure. At the same time, power outages can act as a deterrent to the adoption of cloud services.

In some countries in Uganda, like other parts of the world, limited access to finance and the need to minimise costs during the financial crisis have focused attention on the cloud as a means of reducing capital expenditure and optimising IT resource utilisation amongst even the most risk-averse companies. 

</p><p>The migration of such entities onto the cloud has been managed by creating private clouds that provide these companies with a perceived level of control or ensure that they are aware of where their data is located, which governance rules and what legislation may shortly demand. The public cloud, however, Cloud readiness in selected African countries 3 offers even greater reductions, security and cost savings as a result of the economies of scale, especially useful for companies that are under financial pressure. 

It is, therefore, believed that cost-cutting pressures will force IT-intensive enterprises to migrate to the cloud in an attempt to take advantage of the economies of scale offered by cloud providers. In all the countries selected for this study, cloud-computing services are in the early growth stages. Recently, governments in Ethiopia, Ghana and Kenya have played a lead role in the promotion of cloud services as part of the rollout of e-government strategies. 

</p><p>In addition, there has been increased cloud activity amongst the education sector. While cloud adoption in most of the selected markets has been public-sector driven, in South Africa private-sector demand of services is stimulating growth of cloudcomputing services. The provision of cloud services is mostly supply-side driven, with global and some local IT companies acting as intermediaries, with a few exceptions, where South African-owned companies with a panAfrican reach, like Dimension Data and Internet Solutions compete directly with the global payers and large local IT companies, like Seven Seas Technologies in Kenya. 

On the other hand, telecommunications companies are trying to differentiate their offerings and broaden their revenue streams by leveraging their existing infrastructure and offering cloud services. The services offered by these entities can be differentiated between those intended for large-scale enterprise purposes, SMEs, individual end user, or for personal use. 

</p><p>The focus until now has been on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), which is where cloud development is and where issues of competitiveness will become most pertinent; all of which raise distinct questions around business modelling and regulatory challenges. From the user perspective, however, irrespective of size, cloud computing is a “dynamic utility” that is always available, paid for according to the amount consumed, and can be consumed in any quantity (Kushida, Murray and Zysman, 2012: 65).
Cloud computing is part of the ICT ecosystem, as cloud-computing services require ICT networks and internet infrastructure to function. While there is much hype around the cloud, a critical determinant of cloud diffusion is the availability and affordability of underlying infrastructure (Gillwald et al, 2012).

 </p><p>Other concerns are regulatory in nature, including concerns around security, privacy, surveillance and reliability of networks to further constrain the uptake of cloud services especially in risk-averse sectors like financial services (Gillwald et al, 2012). Although cloud computing falls within ICT, no provision is made for cloud services in all ICT regulatory frameworks in the selected African markets.

Finally, there is a shortage of highly skilled personnel to implement and maintain the solutions. Definitions relating to cloud computing Generally there is disagreement on how cloud computing should be defined and the term means different things to different stakeholders.

 </p><p>According to Gillwald et al (2012), the term “cloud computing” has generally been misused to refer to all forms of data outsourcing and online services. Cloud computing is also used to refer to a means of delivering applications, services or content to end users. This is achieved by making use of storage capacity of large-scale data centres with high-bandwidth communication infrastructure that can achieve economies of scale. 

Cloud computing is based on a utility model for the use of information technology assets and resources, whereby companies pay for what they use. Virtualisation technology constitutes the core cloud-computing technology (that is from infrastructure to terminals), as well as the automation of infrastructure and application processes, which includes configuration, provisioning, auto-scaling and failure recovery (Gillwald et al, 2012 ).
 </p><p>Cloud readiness African countries 4 A widely accepted definition is that of the US National Institute of Science and Technology, NIST (2011) that defines “cloud computing as a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”

 It is important to make a distinction between cloud services and cloud-based services: The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) (2012) defines cloud services that are provided and utilised “on demand at any time, through any access network, using any connected devices [that use] cloudcomputing technologies”.

</p><p> Further, cloud services utilise software and applications that are held in the cloud and not on users’ own devices (ITU, 2012). These are used for internal administration by cloud users or for the management of service delivery to end users. An example is customer relations management. On the other hand, cloud-based services include mass market applications in social networking and webmail offered over the internet to end users. 

Applications include Facebook, You-tube store videos and other data that are then posted on the cloud. That is, the data does not sit on the individuals computers but is stored remotely in data centres. Gmail and hotmail operate in the same manner (Gillwald et al, 2012). Cloud types A distinction is made between private and public cloud services.

</p><p> However the distinction is not clear cut, as cloud providers offer both public and private services and make use of the same data centres. Government and private companies may use more than one cloud service and multiple cloud providers. In this regard, interoperability in the cloud becomes critical as it allows flexibility, facilitates competition and allows companies to switch between one cloud provider and the other (UNCTAD, 2013) A public cloud “is an open resource open to the public”. 
Examples include mass market services like Dropbox and webmail, Apple’s icloud and Facebook that are funded by advertising revenue. In addition these services are able to achieve massive economies of scale (UNCTAD, 2013: xii). A private cloud refers to “a dedicated resource provided by a cloud service provider for a single client/user (for example a government or large business user)” (UNCTAD, 2013: xii). 
</p><p>A community cloud is “a resource/service provided for and shared between a limited range of clients/users. It might be considered half-way between public and private cloud provisioning” (UNCTAD, 2013: xii). A hybrid cloud “is a mixture of the deployment models described above, for example a mix of public and private cloud provision” (UNCTAD, 2013: xii). 

Models of cloud computing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) IaaS is a virtual, cloud-based replacement for physical hardware, such as processors and hard drives (Kushida et al, 2012). Users make use of the storage, networks and other computing resources that allow them to deploy their own software, applications and operating systems. The underlying cloud infrastructure is managed and controlled by a third party. 

</p><p>The user has control over the storage, operating systems and deployed applications, but may have limited control over networking components such as host firewalls (Kushida et al, 2012). Software as a Service (SaaS) Cloud applications are usually delivered in the form of SaaS. Under this model users are able to remove complexities and costs involved in the installation, maintenance and upgrading of complex IT systems in their own environment (Gillwald et al, 2012).

In addition, users take advantage of providers running cloud infrastructure. Users can access Cloud readiness in selected African countries 5 the cloud through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g. webbased e-mail) or a programme interface and have no control over underlying cloud infrastructure (Kushida et al in Gillwald et al, 2012). 

</p><p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) PaaS involves the deployment of a user’s own applications on platform tools, including programming tools that are on infrastructure owned and managed by the cloud provider. For example, application developers working on mobile applications usually use cloudbased platforms to develop and launch their services. 
The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure, including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the applicationhosting environment (Gillwald et al, 2012). The PaaS platform enables them to access a full repertoire of features, which make up the platform.

 </p><p>For example, a developer working on Android applications can use PaaS to ensure that an application can automatically take advantage of changes implemented in, and follow the look and feel of, new releases of the Android operating system as they appear (Kushida et al in Gillwald et al, 2012). Cloud providers According to Kushida et al (2012) cloud providers “create, configure, run and distribute services”.

 </p><p>Aggregators and system aggregators are players that act as intermediaries for cloud providers and manage the cloud migration process by matching their knowledge of global cloud computing technologies with local needs (Odufuwa, 2013). Cloud brokers are third party service providers that act as intermediaries between the end users, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and system integrators (Odufuwa, 2013). 
Locating cloud computing in the broader ICT eco-system Figure 1 below is an illustration of the ICT ecosystem. It provides a conceptual framework in which to analyse the relationship between different elements and the outcomes resulting from their interactions. According to Kaplan (2005) “An ICT ecosystem encompasses the policies, strategies, processes, information, technologies, applications and stakeholders that together make up a technology environment for a country, government or an enterprise. 

</p><p>Most importantly, an ICT ecosystem includes people – diverse individuals – who create, buy, sell, regulate, manage and use technology”. Cloud computing is located within the broader ICT ecosystem as cloud services are delivered via an internet connection. As a result, the reliability of cloud computing is critically dependent upon the availability of underlying broadband infrastructure. The networks, services, applications and content, which together are now conceptualised as the broadband ecosystem (Kim, Kelly and Raja, 2010) and access to and affordability of these services are an outcome of the market structure, institutional arrangements and effectiveness of regulation, which in turn are an outcome of the policy and legal framework (Gillwald, 2012). 

Users, including consumers and citizens, have been placed at the centre of the ecosystem and factors such as price and quality of service are a measure of access and affordability of services provided (Gillwald, 2012). The ability of the policy and legal framework to provide a favourable environment is a major determinant of

	<h4>Conclusion</h4>
	<p>
	Although “cloud providers must be aware of The Ugandan [network connectivity, reliability and security]limitations and tailor their services to accommodate them. They should place particular focus on embracing the growing use of smartphones, tablets and other portable devices for application and service access by workers for both personal and business use, likely to emerge as a key sales strategy for winning corporate contracts.”
