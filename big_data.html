			<h2>An Introduction to Big Data</h2>
			
<p>Big data refers to the idea that society can do things with a large body of data that that weren’t possible when working with smaller amounts. The term was originally applied a decade ago to massive datasets from astrophysics, genomics and internet search engines, and to machine-learning systems (for voice-recognition and translation, for example) that work well only when given lots of data to chew on. K.N.C, (2014).
 </p><p>Big data is a term that describes the large volume of data – both structured and unstructured – that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis. But it’s not the amount of data that’s important.  It is what organizations do with the data that matters. Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business moves.
</p>While the term “big data” is relatively modern, the act of gathering and storing large amounts of information for eventual analysis is ages old. The concept gained momentum in the early 2000s when industry analyst Doug Laney articulated the now-mainstream definition of big data as the three Vs:
 <p>
<b>Volume:</b> Organizations collect data from a variety of sources, including business transactions, social media and information from sensor or machine-to-machine data. In the past, storing it would’ve been a problem – but new technologies (such as Hadoop) have eased the burden.
 </p><p>
<b>Velocity: </b>Data streams in at an unprecedented speed and must be dealt with in a timely manner. RFID tags, sensors and smart metering are driving the need to deal with torrents of data in near-real time.
 </p><p>
<b>Variety: </b>Data comes in all types of formats – from structured, numeric data in traditional databases to unstructured text documents, email, video, audio, stock ticker data and financial transactions.
 
 </p>
 
 
 
 
The importance of big data doesn’t revolve around how much data you have, but what you do with it. You can take data from any source and analyze it to find answers that enable
 
<ol>
<li> cost reductions,
 
</li><li> time reductions,
 
</li><li>  new product development and optimized offerings, and
 
</li><li>  smart decision making.
</li>
</ol>
 
When you combine big data with high-powered analytics, you can accomplish business-related tasks such as:
 
<ul>
<li>Determining root causes of failures, issues and defects in near-real time.
 
</li><li>  Generating coupons at the point of sale based on the customer’s buying habits.
 
</li><li> Recalculating entire risk portfolios in minutes.
 
</li><li>  Detecting fraudulent behavior before it affects your organization.
</li></ul>
								
</p>
<p>
<h2>criticisms of Big Data</h2>
There three data’s big criticisms. They are: hyper-pragmatism, mutual neutralization and advocacy.<br>
 <p>
<b>Hyper-pragmatism</b>
I define this concept as focusing on what works instead of paying attention to the fundamental principles or understanding of why it works. In other words, if something works, that’s all you need to know. For example, credit card companies using big data have found people who purchase chrome skull accessories are prone to miss payments. Those who buy anti-scuff furniture pads pay on time. Why? Who knows. But the big data results seem to work and seem to consistently hold true. Try the same kind of analysis for predicting earthquakes, however, and it doesn’t work at all.
 </p><p>
<b>Mutual Neutralization</b>

Leaky sources are to blame for this one, sources that spill the beans on big-data techniques that have been successful. Once people learn about specific strategies and start to use them on their own, or set up situations that work against them, results become skewed. An example is the massive computerized databases that showcase a full analysis and history of the game of chess. When everyone has access to such info, more players with advanced knowledge are likely to compete in championships, dramatically decreasing an individual’s chances of winning.
  </p><p>
<b>Advocacy</b>
Despite big data often being touted as the latest, greatest thing, there is yet to surface any reliable information on the overall implementation or success of big data projects. One reason behind this fact is because it’s tough to tell where traditional analysis ends and the new, big-data analytics begin. Another reason is that most of the big data projects are carefully guarded, proprietary undertakings.
While it’s unclear when these three major criticisms will be addressed, they don’t appear to halting the use of big data. To amplify the results of your own data, contact mTAB today.

 <h1>because of big data the following technologies that have been born.</h1>
Big data affects organizations across practically every industry. Each industry can benefit from this onslaught of information.
<ol>
<li><p><h4>E-Banking</h4></p></li>
With large amounts of information streaming in from countless sources, banks are faced with finding new and innovative ways to manage big data. While it’s important to understand customers and boost their satisfaction, it’s equally important to minimize risk and fraud while maintaining regulatory compliance. Big data brings big insights, but it also requires financial institutions to stay one step ahead of the game with advanced analytics.
<li><p><h4>E-ducation</h4></p></li>
Educators armed with data-driven insight can make a significant impact on school systems, students and curriculums. By analyzing big data, they can identify at-risk students, make sure students are making adequate progress, and can implement a better system for evaluation and support of teachers and principals.
<li><p><h4>E-Government</h4></p></li>
When government agencies are able to harness and apply analytics to their big data, they gain significant ground when it comes to managing utilities, running agencies, dealing with traffic congestion or preventing crime. But while there are many advantages to big data, governments must also address issues of transparency and privacy.
<li><p><h4>E-Health</h4></p></li>
Used in Patient records, Treatment plans, Prescription information, etc. When it comes to health care, everything needs to be done quickly, accurately – and, in some cases, with enough transparency to satisfy stringent industry regulations. When big data is managed effectively, health care providers can uncover hidden insights that improve patient care.
<li><p><h4>Manufacturing</h4></p></li>
Armed with insight that big data can provide, manufacturers can boost quality and output while minimizing waste – processes that are key in today’s highly competitive market. More and more manufacturers are working in an analytics-based culture, which means they can solve problems faster and make more agile business decisions.
<li><p><h4>E-Retail</h4></p></li>
Customer relationship building is critical to the retail industry – and the best way to manage that is to manage big data. Retailers need to know the best way to market to customers, the most effective way to handle transactions, and the most strategic way to bring back lapsed business. Big data remains at the heart of all those things.
</ol>

<h1>Big Data in Uganda</h1>

<p>There is no doubt about the potential of Big Data in Africa’s development.  Uganda has taken great strides in the technological and policy prerequisites necessary for big data impact. The explosion in the growth of the ICT industry, the rise of the use of mobile technology for financial and development transactions have been well documented. In Uganda for example, Mobile money financial transactions are changing the way business is done, helping the rural poor leverage microfinance and carry out profitable self-sustaining small businesses without any need for big banks.

</p><p>With more than 13 million mobile-phone users in Uganda, phone data presents enormous opportunities for decision-makers. From humanitarian assistance to disease epidemiology and climate change mitigation, these data are helping boost life-changing decision making.


</p><p>


</p><p>Data-based decision making is connecting countries on the vast continent than ever before, from regional integration in general to trade cooperation specifically.  For example, from The African Union’s Regional Integration Index, a data aggregation tool summarizing info on more than 70 indicators, enabling countries to check the performance of peers in their regional economic communities, to the massive databases of the continent’s telecom giants and the satellite-based data collection by some entities, there are few better places where the promise of the global Data Revolution is more apparent.

</h4>Danger of Overstating impacts of Big Data</h4>

</p><p>There is need for caution however, when discussing the impact of Big Data on Africa’s development.

</p><p>The excitement generated by the possibilities described above has sometimes led to simplistic cause-effect attribution of change to Big Data, without adequate consideration of the “correlation doesn’t necessarily mean causation” truism which would mean taking stock of Africa’s unique Social-political, technological context and other factors before determining matter-of-factly whether some of the changes we see in these studies are solely a result of data.

</p><p>A number of studies on the impact of Big Data and open data in Uganda have already been done, some with some sweeping conclusions that call for caution from advocates and researchers.

</p><p>Privacy issues of Big Data

</p><p>Data protection and privacy, important elements of Big Data are still underdeveloped in most of Uganda. Most countries still do not have Data Protection and privacy laws in place, and given that most governments are hybrid regimes with authoritarian and semi-democratic tendencies, there is a danger that Big Data may be exploited to the detriment of rights of citizens. Telecommunications companies remain biggest holders of Big Data in Uganda, and most of them are in cahoots with Governments and easily relinquish client data which is used for surveillance of critics, as seen in the recent mass apposition surveillance scandal in Uganda. This is an issue that is always put at the periphery or sometimes not mentioned at all in touting the impact of Big Data.

</p><p>At the “Big Data in the Global South” Conference hosted by the Institute of Technology and Society in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, in November, Which I was privileged to attend, these and other issues were spotlighted, but again there wasn’t enough appreciation of the fact that the “Global South” is by no means a universal region. Uganda especially stands apart for its unique historical, technological and sociopolitical context and this affects its experiences with any development interventions.

<h4>In conclusion</h4>

</p><p>Overstating the impact of Big Data, open data and other data or techie-enabled interventions to development is to do a disservice to these initiatives in the long run as it prevents a more thorough understanding of the challenges and opportunities of these initiatives for better conceptualization, targeting and improvement.

</p><p>The takeaway therefore is that Big Data doesn’t, and cannot provide all the answers in development theory, or practice in Uganda, even with its obvious potential. Acknowledging Big Data’s obvious limits helps development actors and big data advocates to devise ways of improving the impact.

Most data scientists are modest in acknowledging these limits. We advocates however, tend to be too </p> in stating the case for big data and open data. Different contexts at play need to be put into consideration in making the case for the potential and real impact of these initiatives.
